## Purpose
Purpose of this project is to explore what architecture, enterprise design and software engineering can accomplish within digital product development.  
The purpose is to build practical tools. For this, a workshop where these tools can be built is needed and that is what we try to accomplish here. 
To become more specific and start adding some constraints, we focus mainly on records management and information governance domain.
We are inspired by Edgy and EDF/Intersections.

## Insights
Research work need to be done but it also need methods and tools. It is not only a 'wicked problem' but a 'wicked mess'. This is where work must start. We have a suggestion for method and tool, 'Periodic System' which consists of a 'Particle Cloud' being transformed and done in mainly draw.io for which we have a template. 

Problem definition is often not done enough. This is different from problem understanding which is where work often starts, and then often also done from a single framing, such as 'Users'. Instead it must be much broader, Edgy and EDF are framework we suggest which also continues in other areas of work.

There is often a lack of understanding for the material from which digital products are built. We suggest an object oriented approach from the software engineering domain because it can be directly represented on all levels within Edgy and EDF in the form of 'abstract base classes', 'capabilities', the 'ABCDesEnt'-model, see more in 'TheDigitalMaterial'(PDF)

## Hypotheses
This place do not aim to provide products to address the insights we have found. Instead we aim to build a workshop for producing them. Things, tools, products, methods in ways that work in real projects for real users. 
Since the problems these products are addressing are different, the way to design and build them need to be different. Thus, the workshop need constantly be re-designed also and thinking about this, pivoting is necessary. This is what we aim. This is also called double loop learning. 
Put another way, if we visalize varying needs in the form of a graph, the derivative will be a slope and second derivative a straight line. This is what we aim for, an workshop that continously learn and adapt. Then we can build products.

Design is about organising the parts of a product in its entirety(Rams).
Enterprises can be understood by it's part described according to Edgy or Enterprise Design Framework. With 'enterprise' can also be meant smaller parts like a team, a certain service or department or any other phenomenon in a business. All these parts are needed to provide digital products. 
We assume then that with a designerly, architectural and software engineering approach it is possible to design an enterprise and its products. 

The way to address knowledge about the digital material the best way is to start with object orientation. It is not possible to sell a feature, a digital device, an architecture or platform or service. It is only possible to sell use-cases ,everything else is a cost and thus these need to be reconciled to make the product commercially viable.

As in ship building the basic forms are given. In digital products this is sometimes forgotten. The pattern movement address this. We think that the basic pattern is object orientation and business impact and user outcomes can be viewed as abstract base classes and thus possible to align everything in an enterprise, from strategy, ways of working, to practical implementation and rendering of products in software.
