## Purpose
Purpose of this project is to explore what architecture, enterprise design and software engineering can accomplish within digital product development.  
The purpose is to build practical tools. For this, a workshop where these tools can be built is needed and that is what we try to accomplish here. 
To become more specific and start adding some constraints, we focus mainly on records management and information governance domain.
We are inspired by Edgy and EDF/Intersections.

## Insights
Research work need to be done but it also need methods and tools. It is not only a 'wicked problem' but a 'wicked mess'. This is where work must start. We have a suggestion for method and tool, 'Periodic System' which consists of a 'Particle Cloud' being transformed and done in mainly draw.io for which we have a template. 

Problem definition is often not done enough. This is different from problem understanding which is where work often starts, and then often also done from a single framing, such as 'Users'. Instead it must be much broader, Edgy and EDF are framework we suggest which also continues in other areas of work.

There is often a lack of understanding for the material from which digital products are built. We suggest an object oriented approach from the software engineering domain because it can be directly represented on all levels within Edgy and EDF in the form of 'abstract base classes', 'capabilities', the 'ABCDesEnt'-model, see more in 'TheDigitalMaterial'(PDF)
