## Purpose
Purpose of this project is to explore what architecture, enterprise design and software engineering can accomplish within digital product development.  
The purpose is to build practical tools. For this, a workshop where these tools can be built is needed and that is what we try to accomplish here. 
To become more specific and start adding some constraints, we focus mainly on records management and information governance domain.
We are inspired by Edgy and EDF/Intersections.

## Insights
Research work need to be done but it also need methods and tools. It is not only a 'wicked problem' but a 'wicked mess'. This is where work must start. We have a suggestion for method and tool, 'Periodic System' which consists of a 'Particle Cloud' being transformed and done in mainly draw.io for which we have a template. 

Problem definition is often not done enough. This is different from problem understanding which is where work often starts, and then often also done from a single framing, such as 'Users'. Instead it must be much broader, Edgy and EDF are framework we suggest which also continues in other areas of work.

There is often a lack of understanding for the material from which digital products are built. We suggest an object oriented approach from the software engineering domain because it can be directly represented on all levels within Edgy and EDF in the form of 'abstract base classes', 'capabilities', the 'ABCDesEnt'-model, see more in 'TheDigitalMaterial'(PDF)

## Hypothesis
This place do not aim to provide products to address the insights we have found. Instead we aim to build a workshop for producing them. Things, tools, products, methods in ways that work in real projects for real users. 
Since the problems these products are addressing are different, the way to design and build them need to be different. Thus, the workshop need constantly be re-designed also and thinking about this, pivoting is necessary. This is what we aim. This is also called double loop learning. 
Put another way, if we visalize varying needs in the form of a graph, the derivative will be a slope and second derivative a straight line. This is what we aim for, an workshop that continously learn and adapt. Then we can build products.s
